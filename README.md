# About Me

**Data Science & Engineering Enthusiast | MS in Data Science, UMass Dartmouth | 3+ Years as Data Engineer at Infosys**

I'm on a mission to unlock the power of data! Through hands-on projects, I'm constantly learning and growing in data science and engineering. Dive into my GitHub profile to see how I bring data to life in real-world projects. I'm stoked to collaborate, explore new opportunities, and connect with like-minded folks. Take a look around, and feel free to reach out via email if you'd like to chat!
